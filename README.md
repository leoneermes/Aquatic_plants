# Aquatic_plants
Hello! Here you can find the 3D file for the aquatic plant experimental hardware. You can find the file in different versions. Please read the README file before downloading.

This repository contains files for the experimental hardware that I have developed. In this README file, I will explain what you can find in this repository and how to use the files.

Files Included
In this repository, you will find the following files:

[Name of File 1].stl
[Name of File 2].stl
[Name of File 3].stl
[Name of File 4].stl
[Name of File 5].stl
[Name of File 6].gcode
The .stl files are editable files that can be opened in 3D design software. If you want to make any changes to the design, you can download these files and make the changes in your preferred 3D design software.

The .gcode file is a file that can be fed directly to a 3D printer without any modifications. If you don't know how to 3D design, you can simply download this file and feed it to your 3D printer to print the design.

How to Use the Files
To use the .stl files, you will need to have 3D design software installed on your computer. There are many free 3D design software options available online, such as Tinkercad or Fusion 360.

To use the .gcode file, you will need a 3D printer that is compatible with the file format. You can use the software that came with your 3D printer to upload the .gcode file and start printing.
